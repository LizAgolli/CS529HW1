I edited the python scripts to add columns for victim counts by sex and victims per million in each state to prepare the data for visualization. There was a male count component and it could be used to calculate non-male victims (assumed female) but there could be intersex individuals with this much data. I wanted to mirror the black hat visualizations in color a bit (namely, red is bad). Since all gun violence is bad, I used the YlOrRd color pallet, so there is no green and it is colorblind friendly as well as easy to read if printed in black and white. For my second plot I stacked the male and female counts and sorted by total so the viewer could get some insight as to victim gender ratio along with the total.
